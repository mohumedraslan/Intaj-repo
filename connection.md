🛠️ Ultimate Guide: Connecting Your Website with Multi-Channel Chatbots
🎯 Goal

When a business visits your agency website, they should:

Connect their platform (WhatsApp, FB, IG, X).

Deploy a chatbot instantly.

View/manage conversations (MVP: Google Sheets, later dashboard).

🔑 Step 1. WhatsApp Integration
Options

WhatsApp Business Cloud API (Meta Official) ✅

Create app in Meta for Developers
.

Connect WhatsApp Business Number.

Use API endpoint to send/receive messages.

Free: 1,000 conv./month.

Paid: $0.01–$0.05/conv.

Implementation Path:

Website → “Connect WhatsApp” button.

Redirect to Meta OAuth → client approves → you store access token.

n8n workflow:

Webhook → receive messages → GPT API → reply via WhatsApp Cloud API.

Unofficial Libraries (Not recommended) ❌

Baileys / Venom-bot (scrapes WhatsApp Web).

Free but risky (bans).

Only for testing MVP, not production.

👉 Best Choice: WhatsApp Cloud API

🔑 Step 2. Facebook & Instagram Messenger
Options

Meta Graph API (Official) ✅

Single API works for both FB + Insta.

Requires Facebook App + Page Access Token.

Free (except hosting).

Implementation Path:

Website → “Connect FB/Instagram” → OAuth login.

Store Page Access Token.

n8n workflow:

Webhook listens for messages → passes to GPT logic → replies via Graph API.

Third-Party SaaS (like ManyChat, Tidio) ❌

Paid, vendor lock-in, less flexible.

👉 Best Choice: Meta Graph API directly with n8n

🔑 Step 3. Twitter / X
Options

Twitter API v2 (Official) ✅

Can read DMs, mentions, reply.

Limited free tier. Paid tiers scale.

Implementation Path:

Website → “Connect X” → OAuth login.

Store access token.

n8n workflow:

Check mentions/DMs → pass to GPT logic → reply.

👉 Best Choice: Twitter API v2 (for later stage, not MVP-critical)

🔑 Step 4. Website Chatbot
Options

Embed Open-Source Bot ✅

Botpress / Flowise / Rasa: Self-host, free.

Add <script> widget on client’s site.

Use SaaS Chat Widgets

Tidio, Crisp, Intercom ($15–$50/mo).

Easy, but costs.

👉 Best Choice: Botpress widget (open-source, free)

🔑 Step 5. Conversation Storage
Options

MVP (Cheap/Fast) ✅

Google Sheets / Airtable (via n8n nodes).

Pro

Database: MongoDB Atlas (free tier), PostgreSQL.

Store: user ID, platform, message, timestamp.

👉 Best Choice for MVP: Google Sheets

🔑 Step 6. Dashboard for Clients
Options

MVP ✅

Google Sheets as “chat inbox”.

⚡ Recommended MVP Architecture

Flow:
Client → Your Website → Connect Platform → Store Access Token → n8n → API → Chatbot → Reply + Log

[User Message] → [Platform API (WhatsApp/Facebook/Insta/X/Web)]
→ [n8n Webhook] → [LLM/GPT Logic Node]
→ [API Response back to platform] + [Log in Google Sheets]
