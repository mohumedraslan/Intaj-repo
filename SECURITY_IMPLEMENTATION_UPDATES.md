# Security Implementation Updates

## 2025-09-08

### Actions Taken
- Implemented `generateSetup` in `TwoFactorAuth` to return secret, QR code, and backup codes.
- Updated `/api/auth/2fa/setup` to use the new method.
- Refactored `TwoFactorSetup` component to match Intaj design system (glass-card, gradients, rounded corners, color palette).
- All UI and backend logic for 2FA setup now follows business and design guidelines.

### Suggestions / Next Steps
- If you want to further customize the backup code generation or add more security checks, let me know.
- If you want to add more visual feedback (animations, loaders, etc.), I can enhance the UI further.
- If you want to add SOC2 or API key rotation next, just say "continue".

### Manual Actions Required
- None at this stage. If you encounter any issues, notify me and I'll resolve them.

## 2025-09-08 (Update 2)

### Actions Taken

- Implemented `enable2FA` in `TwoFactorAuth` to verify token and (stub) update user profile.
- Updated `/api/auth/2fa/verify` to use the new function and fixed cookies usage.
- Improved input field contrast in `TwoFactorSetup` to match design and improve accessibility.

### Suggestions / Next Steps

- You should connect the `enable2FA` logic to your actual database to update the user's 2FA status and store the secret securely.
- If you want to show a success animation or redirect after enabling 2FA, let me know.

### Manual Actions Required

- Please update the stub in `enable2FA` to fetch and store secrets from your database for production use.
