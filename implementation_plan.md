# Implementation Plan & Prompts

This document breaks down the vision into actionable steps and prompts for building the platform.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

This phase focuses on setting up a robust and scalable foundation for the project.

- **Prompt 1: Setup Project Structure**
    - Initialize a Git repository.
    - Create a directory structure:
        ```
        /
        ├── backend/         # For all backend services (e.g., API, agent logic)
        ├── frontend/        # For the user-facing web application
        ├── docs/            # For documentation
        ├── scripts/         # For deployment or utility scripts
        └── vision.md
        └── implementation_plan.md
        ```
    - Add a `.gitignore` file with standard ignores for Python/Node.js.
    - Create README.md files for the `backend` and `frontend` directories explaining their purpose.

- **Prompt 2: Backend API Scaffolding**
    - Choose a backend framework (e.g., FastAPI or Django for Python, Express.js for Node.js).
    - Create a basic "Hello World" API endpoint.
    - Set up a virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` (or `package.json`).
    - Implement basic user authentication (Register/Login).
    - Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL with an ORM like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM). Define initial models for `User`, `Agent`, and `Plan`.

- **Prompt 3: Frontend Application Scaffolding**
    - Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte).
    - Use a tool like `create-react-app` or `vite` to bootstrap the application.
    - Create a simple, clean UI with placeholders for:
        - Login/Register pages.
        - A dashboard page (to be populated later).
        - A navigation bar.
    - Connect the frontend to the backend's authentication endpoints.

## Phase 2: Core Platform Features (Week 3-6)

This phase focuses on building the features that allow users to manage agents.

- **Prompt 4: Implement Agent Management**
    - **Backend:**
        - Create API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Agents.
        - Agents should have properties like `name`, `role` (e.g., 'Sales', 'Support'), `status` ('active', 'inactive'), and configuration settings.
    - **Frontend:**
        - Build a UI for users to view their agents.
        - Create a form to "hire" (create) a new agent, allowing the user to select a role and provide a name.
        - Implement functionality to activate/deactivate or delete an agent.

- **Prompt 5: Develop the First Agent - "Email Manager"**
    - **Backend:**
        - Design the core logic for the Email Manager agent.
        - It should be able to connect to an email account (e.g., via IMAP/SMTP or a provider's API like Gmail).
        - Implement a basic skill: sorting incoming emails into predefined categories (e.g., 'Important', 'Spam', 'Promotions').
        - This will require secure storage for user email credentials (use a secure vault solution).
    - **Frontend:**
        - Create a configuration page for the Email Manager agent where users can input their email credentials securely and set up sorting rules.

## Phase 3: Billing & Deployment (Week 7-8)

This phase focuses on monetization and making the platform available to users.

- **Prompt 6: Integrate a Payment System**
    - **Backend:**
        - Integrate with a payment provider like Stripe or Braintree.
        - Create API endpoints to handle subscription plans (e.g., 'Basic', 'Pro', 'Enterprise').
        - Implement logic to restrict feature access based on the user's subscription plan.
    - **Frontend:**
        - Create a pricing page that displays the different plans.
        - Build a checkout flow for users to subscribe to a plan.
        - Create a billing portal where users can manage their subscription.

- **Prompt 7: Prepare for Deployment**
    - **Backend:**
        - Containerize the backend application using Docker.
        - Create a deployment script (e.g., using shell scripts or an IaC tool like Terraform).
        - Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment.
    - **Frontend:**
        - Containerize the frontend application using Docker.
        - Update the CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3/CloudFront).

This implementation plan provides the next set of tasks. We can now begin with **Prompt 1: Setup Project Structure**. What should I do next?
