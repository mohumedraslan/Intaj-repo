### ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase: Backend Implementation

## Backend Development Prompts

### Prompt 1: Project Context & Architecture
```
You are a senior full-stack engineer joining the Intaj project. Here's what's been built:

Frontend:
- Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Authentication UI (login/signup)
- Landing and services pages
- Contact integration

Required Backend Features:
1. Auth system with Supabase
2. Multi-channel chatbot integration (WhatsApp, FB, IG)
3. Stripe payment integration
4. OpenAI/OpenRouter for chatbot responses
5. File storage and vector search
6. Usage tracking and rate limiting

Please help implement these features following best practices and security standards. We'll tackle them one by one.

For context, refer to:
1. connection.md - Integration architecture
2. DB_DESCRIPTION.md - Database schema
3. Current frontend implementation

Let's start with [specific feature] implementation.
```

### Prompt 2: Supabase Auth Implementation
```
Help implement Supabase authentication in our Next.js app. Requirements:

1. Email/password and OAuth authentication
2. Protected routes and middleware
3. User profiles with subscription status
4. Session management
5. Type-safe database queries

Use the existing auth UI components in src/app/auth/.
Implement proper error handling and loading states.
```

### Prompt 3: Stripe Integration
```
Implement Stripe payment processing for Intaj. Requirements:

1. Subscription plans (Free, Pro)
2. Secure webhook handling
3. Usage tracking and limits

2. Facebook/Instagram Messenger API
3. Web widget implementation
4. Message queueing and rate limiting
5. Error handling and retries

Focus on scalability and maintainability.
Consider using n8n for initial MVP workflow automation.
```

### Prompt 5: OpenAI/OpenRouter Integration
```
Implement the AI chat functionality using OpenAI/OpenRouter. Requirements:

1. Streaming responses
2. Context management
3. Rate limiting
4. Error handling
5. Model switching capability
6. Usage tracking

Consider implementing fallback options and retry logic.
```

### Prompt 6: File Storage & Vector Search
```
Implement document processing and vector search. Requirements:

1. File upload to Supabase storage
2. Text extraction and processing
3. Vector embedding generation
4. Efficient vector search
5. Result ranking and filtering

Focus on performance and scalability.
```

### Prompt 7: Testing & Deployment
```
Help set up testing and deployment pipeline. Requirements:

1. Unit and integration tests
2. End-to-end testing
3. CI/CD with GitHub Actions
4. Production environment setup
5. Monitoring and logging

Focus on reliability and maintainability.
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Use these prompts in order, one at a time
2. Each prompt builds on the previous implementation
3. Always ask for clarification if needed
4. Keep security and scalability in mind
5. Follow TypeScript best practices
6. Maintain consistent error handling
7. Document all implementations
8. Add tests for new features

## Example Usage

When starting a new feature:
1. Use the Project Context prompt first
2. Then use the specific feature prompt
3. Ask for clarification on requirements if needed
4. Request code review and testing guidance

## Security Notes

- Always verify user permissions
