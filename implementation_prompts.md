### Prompt 14: Implement Real Analytics Metrics (Backend + Frontend)
```
The analytics dashboard in `src/app/analytics/page.tsx` is currently using simulated data. We need to replace this with real, efficiently-queried data from our Supabase database.

**Part 1: Backend (Supabase RPC Functions)**

1.  **Create a new SQL file** in `db/` named `analytics_functions.sql`.
2.  In this file, create a Supabase RPC function called `get_analytics_metrics`. This function should:
    *   Accept `user_id_param` (uuid) and `time_range_param` (text, e.g., '7d', '30d') as arguments.
    *   Return a JSON object with the following real metrics for the given user and time range:
        *   `total_conversations`: Count of messages where `role = 'user'`.
        *   `active_bots`: Count of chatbots where `status = 'active'`.
        *   `avg_response_time`: This is tricky. For now, you can return a hardcoded value like `1.2` seconds. We can implement a more accurate version later.
        *   `conversion_rate`: This is also complex. For now, simulate it by taking `(total_conversations * 0.15)`.
        *   `bot_performance`: An array of JSON objects, one for each chatbot belonging to the user. Each object should contain:
            *   `name`: The chatbot's name.
            *   `channel`: The platform from the `connections` table (e.g., 'Website', 'WhatsApp'). Default to 'Website' if no connection is found.
            *   `conversations`: The number of conversations for that bot.
            *   `success_rate`: A simulated value for now (e.g., `80 + random() * 15`).
            *   `response_time`: A simulated value for now (e.g., `(1 + random() * 2) || 's'`).
            *   `status`: The chatbot's status.
    *   Refer to `db/DB_DESCRIPTION.md` for table schemas (`messages`, `chatbots`, `connections`).
    *   Ensure the function is secure and only returns data for the provided `user_id_param`.

**Part 2: Frontend (Update Analytics Page)**

1.  **Modify `src/app/analytics/page.tsx`**.
2.  In the `fetchAnalyticsData` function, remove the separate fetches for `chatbots`, `messages`, and `connections`.
3.  **Call the new RPC function** instead:
    ```javascript
    const { data: analyticsData, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_analytics_metrics', {
      user_id_param: user.id,
      time_range_param: timeRange
    });
    ```
4.  **Update the state** using the data returned from the RPC function.
    *   Replace all the hardcoded and simulated metric calculations (`totalConversations`, `activeBots`, `avgResponseTime`, `conversionRate`, `botPerformanceData`) with the values from `analyticsData`.
    *   The `change` and `trend` values for the top-level metrics can remain hardcoded for now, as calculating them requires historical data, which is a separate task.

By the end of this task, the analytics dashboard should display real data from the database, even if some of the more complex metrics are still simulated within the SQL function.
```

### Prompt 15: Implement Analytics Charts and Export
```
The analytics dashboard in `src/app/analytics/page.tsx` has placeholder sections for charts and a non-functional "Export Report" button. Let's implement these features.

**Prerequisites:**
*   You will need a charting library. Install `recharts` and its types: `npm install recharts @types/recharts`.

**Part 1: Implement Charts**

1.  **Create a new RPC function** in `db/analytics_functions.sql` called `get_conversations_over_time`.
    *   It should accept `user_id_param` (uuid) and `time_range_param` (text) as arguments.
    *   It should return a list of daily conversation counts for the last 7 or 30 days. Each row should have a `date` and `count`.
    *   You can use `date_trunc('day', created_at)` to group messages by day.
2.  **Modify `src/app/analytics/page.tsx`**:
    *   Import `ResponsiveContainer`, `BarChart`, `Bar`, `XAxis`, `YAxis`, `CartesianGrid`, `Tooltip` from `recharts`.
    *   In `fetchAnalyticsData`, call your new `get_conversations_over_time` RPC function.
    *   Store the chart data in a new state variable.
    *   Replace the placeholder `div` for the "Conversations Over Time" chart with a real `<BarChart>` component from `recharts`, using the data you fetched.
    *   Style the chart to match the dark, modern theme of the dashboard. Use gradients for the bars.

**Part 2: Implement Export Functionality**

1.  **Create a helper function** that converts an array of objects (the `botPerformance` data) into a CSV string.
    *   The first line of the string should be the headers (e.g., "Bot Name,Channel,Conversations").
    *   Each subsequent line should be the data for one bot.
2.  **Modify the "Export Report" button** in `src/app/analytics/page.tsx`.
3.  When the button is clicked:
    *   Call the CSV conversion function with the `botPerformance` data.
    *   Create a `Blob` from the CSV string with `type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;'`.
    *   Create a temporary link (`<a>` element) with a `href` pointing to `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`.
    *   Set the `download` attribute of the link to something like `intaj-performance-report.csv`.
    *   Programmatically click the link to trigger the download.
    *   Clean up by revoking the object URL.

By the end of this task, the dashboard should display an interactive bar chart of conversation history and the "Export Report" button should download a CSV file of the bot performance data.
```

### Prompt 16: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
```
We need to enhance user security by adding Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) two-factor authentication (2FA). We will use the `speakeasy` and `qrcode` libraries.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Install the necessary libraries: `npm install speakeasy qrcode @types/speakeasy @types/qrcode`.

**Part 1: Backend API Endpoints**

1.  **Database:** Add a new table `user_2fa_secrets` to the database with columns: `user_id` (uuid, FK to auth.users), `secret` (text, encrypted), `enabled` (boolean).
2.  **Create API Endpoint for Setup (`/api/auth/2fa/setup`):**
    *   This `POST` endpoint should be protected, requiring an authenticated user.
    *   Generate a new 2FA secret using `speakeasy.generateSecret({ name: 'Intaj AI (user.email)' })`.
    *   Save the `base32` version of the secret to the `user_2fa_secrets` table for the user (remember to encrypt it first!).
    *   Respond with the `otpauth_url` from the secret. Do **not** send the secret itself back to the client.
3.  **Create API Endpoint for Verification (`/api/auth/2fa/verify`):**
    *   This `POST` endpoint accepts a `token` from the user.
    *   Retrieve the user's saved (and decrypted) 2FA secret from the database.
    *   Use `speakeasy.totp.verify()` to check if the provided token is valid.
    *   If valid, update the `enabled` flag for the user's 2FA secret to `true`. Respond with success.
    *   If invalid, respond with an error.
4.  **Create API Endpoint for Disabling (`/api/auth/2fa/disable`):**
    *   A `POST` endpoint that requires a valid 2FA token to disable 2FA.
    *   Verify the token first.
    *   If valid, remove the user's 2FA record from the database.

**Part 2: Frontend UI**

1.  **Create a new component `TwoFactorSetup` in `src/components/security/`**.
2.  This component should be displayed on the user's `/profile` page.
3.  **Setup Flow:**
    *   A button "Enable 2FA" calls the `/api/auth/2fa/setup` endpoint.
    *   On success, it receives the `otpauth_url`.
    *   Use the `qrcode` library to convert the `otpauth_url` into a data URL and display it as an image (`<img src={qrCodeDataUrl} />`).
    *   Show an input field for the user to enter the 6-digit token from their authenticator app.
    *   A "Verify" button sends the token to `/api/auth/2fa/verify`.
    *   On success, show a confirmation message.
4.  **Disable Flow:**
    *   If 2FA is enabled, show a "Disable 2FA" button.
    *   This button should prompt the user for a current 2FA token and then call the `/api/auth/2fa/disable` endpoint.

**Part 3: Integrate into Login Flow**

1.  Modify the main login logic. After a user successfully authenticates with their password, check if they have 2FA enabled.
2.  If they do, redirect them to a new page (e.g., `/auth/2fa`) where they must enter their 2FA token to complete the login.

This is a complex task. Ensure you handle all states (loading, error, success) and provide clear instructions to the user throughout the UI.
```
