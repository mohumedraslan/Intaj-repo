## üéØ Verified Feature Status

This document provides a clear and accurate assessment of the project's current state after a thorough code review. It supersedes all previous status documents.

---

### 1. Modern Analytics Dashboard
- **Status:** üî¥ **Prototype / Incomplete**
- **Summary:** The UI is visually impressive and well-designed, but it is not a functional feature. Core analytics are simulated with hardcoded or random data. Key features like charts and data exports are missing.
- **Action Required:** Requires significant backend work to calculate real metrics and implementation of frontend charting.

---

### 2. WhatsApp Business API Integration
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete & Production-Ready**
- **Summary:** This integration is fully implemented, secure, and robust. It correctly handles the full message lifecycle, including AI-powered responses and database logging.
- **Action Required:** None. This feature is ready for production.

---

### 3. Facebook Messenger Integration
- **Status:** üü† **Critically Flawed / Incomplete**
- **Summary:** This feature is approximately 95% complete. The integration library is excellent and the webhook logic is well-structured. However, a **critical bug in the webhook's security signature verification** makes the entire integration non-functional.
- **Action Required:** Fix the signature verification bug.

---

### 4. Instagram Integration
- **Status:** üü† **Critically Flawed / Incomplete**
- **Summary:** Similar to the Facebook integration, this feature is about 95% complete. The library is outstanding and handles DMs, stories, and comments correctly. However, it suffers from the **exact same critical signature verification bug** as the Facebook integration, rendering it inoperable.
- **Action Required:** Fix the signature verification bug.

## üìã Action Plan & Prioritized TODO List

This list represents the immediate priorities to prepare the platform for launch.

###  –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ (Critical)
- [ ] **Fix Facebook & Instagram Webhook Security:**
  - In `src/app/api/webhooks/facebook/route.ts`, correct the signature verification to use the `sha1` algorithm with the `x-hub-signature` header.
  - In `src/app/api/webhooks/instagram/route.ts`, correct the signature verification to use the `sha1` algorithm with the `x-hub-signature` header.

### ÿπÿßŸÑ (High Priority)
- [ ] **Implement Real Analytics Metrics:**
  - Create Supabase RPC functions to efficiently calculate real analytics data (e.g., avg. response time, conversion rates, success rates).
  - Replace all simulated/hardcoded data in `src/app/analytics/page.tsx` with calls to these new functions.
- [ ] **Implement Analytics Charts:**
  - Integrate a charting library (e.g., Recharts) into `src/app/analytics/page.tsx`.
  - Create the "Conversations Over Time" and "Channel Performance" charts with real data.
- [ ] **Implement Analytics Export:**
  - Add functionality to the "Export Report" button to download the performance breakdown as a CSV file.

### ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑ (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Add 2FA Support:**
  - Implement the UI and backend logic for Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) two-factor authentication.
- [ ] **Create User Onboarding Flow:**
  - Design and implement a guided tour or checklist for new users to help them set up their first chatbot and connection.
- [ ] **Build Connection UI:**
  - Create a user-friendly interface for users to add their WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram credentials.

### ŸÖŸÜÿÆŸÅÿ∂ (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Improve Webhook Connection Logic:**
  - Refactor the connection lookup in the Facebook and Instagram webhooks to be more robust than the current simplified logic.
- [ ] **Add API Documentation:**
  - Set up Swagger or OpenAPI to document the platform's API endpoints.
- [ ] **Set up CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Create a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployments.
